# So Who Am I Then

Hello everyone! 👐

My real name is Tran Anh Khoa but most of my friends just only know my nickname as Yonnon, and I’m thrilled to welcome you to my new blog. I’m a `Website Developer` and `Software Engineering` for almost 2 years. Especially I'm really get into `VueJs`, `Quasar`, `Javascript` and currently I'm trying to learning `Astro` and `Golang` as well. Those stuff is truly fun !

I grew up in the countryside of Vietnam which as had really poor condition even to live and move to Ho Chi Minh city for study there, I studied Information Technology and actually I'm kinda enjoy study by the way :) So I think if I got scholarship there a high rate that I gonna study more at school, but now I'm just only focus at self-study (yah of course we must keep it even we finished or dropped out from school right 😅). Over the years, I’ve had the pleasure of working on several exciting projects. I'm gonna show you guys in the next post!!!

When I’m not working, you’ll find me enjoying learning languages, and yah of course I'm a languages lover !.
I am able to speak `English` and `Chinese` and a bit `Japanese`. Whether I’m kinda fulfilled with works and life stuff, I always find time to indulge in what I love.

Through this blog, I aim to share my journey, insights, and let people know more about me. I’m excited to connect with like-minded individuals and provide valuable content that I hope you’ll find both interesting and useful.

Feel free to drop a comment or connect with me on `Social Media`. I already put the link down below, please check it out. I look forward to engaging with you!

Thank you for joining me on this adventure. Stay tuned for more updates!

Best,
Yonnon 💗
