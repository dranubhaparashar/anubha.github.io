# This is a Pinned Post

This post has the `pinned: true` flag in its frontmatter, which means it will always appear at the top of the blog listing, regardless of its publication date.

## How to Pin a Post

To pin a post to the top of your blog, simply add the following to your post's frontmatter:

```yaml
pinned: true
```

This will ensure that the post is always displayed at the top of your blog's main page and archive listings.

## When to Use Pinned Posts

Pinned posts are useful for:

- Important announcements
- Welcome messages for new visitors
- Featured content you want to highlight
- Guides or tutorials that are particularly useful

You can have multiple pinned posts. They will be sorted by their publication date, with the most recent pinned post appearing first.
