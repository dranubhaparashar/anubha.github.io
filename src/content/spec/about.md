# ðŸš€ About Me
Greetings! I'm Christian "Futz", but you can call me either Chris or Santi (short for Santiago). I'm a somewhat recent Dickinson College graduate, class of 2024 (oh boy how time flies). I completed a B.S in Computer Science and a B.A in Spanish Language and Literature during my time at Dickinson. I've previously worked as an intern web developer for the Dickinson Computer Science Department and as a Cloud Automation Intern for a contractor. Back in Maryland, I'm looking for exciting CS opportunities to further my career and continue learning new technologies while freshening up on my current tech stack. In my free time, I'm working on individual projects.
